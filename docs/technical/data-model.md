## Shared record rules

- All business tables contain `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `version`; archive-capable tables also contain `deleted_at`.
- IDs are UUIDv7. Timestamps are UTC ISO-8601 values.
- Business identifiers such as invoice numbers are unique within the deployment.
- Each deployment contains one firm only; its data is isolated by its dedicated application, database, secrets, and storage connection.

## Operational tables

The migration ledger (`taxdesk_migration_ledger`) is operational metadata rather
than a business table: it records the name, SHA-256 checksum, UTC timestamp,
duration, and applying database role of each forward-only migration. It is
bootstrapped by the migration runner and is never edited by hand. See
[migrations.md](migrations.md) for the schema, checksum rules, and rollback
policy.

## Integrity rules

- Tax identifiers use encrypted ciphertext for display and an HMAC blind index for exact duplicate detection.
- A case retains a snapshot of its selected workflow and checklist template version.
- Status history is append-only.
- Draft invoices may change; final invoices, payments, and reversals cannot be edited or deleted.
- A payment reversal references one original payment and may not exceed that payment's unreversed amount.
- Invoice balance is derived and updated atomically within the transaction that changes financial entries.
- Documents store provider-neutral external identifiers, metadata, verification state, and linkage to client/case/checklist item; file bytes never enter PostgreSQL.
- Audit events exclude raw credentials, refresh tokens, and unmasked national identifiers.
